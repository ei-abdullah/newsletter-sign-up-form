## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

- TailwindCSS: This is my first TailwindCSS project and through this project, I improved my tailwindcss skills and created beautiful and responsive design in way less than time than I would do using CSS.

- JavaScript: In this project, I execute regular expressions which I have learned couple weeks age. It is due to regExp, I was able to handle form without writing unnecessary conditional statements.

```js
 const email = emailInput.value;
  const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;

  if (emailPattern.test(email)) {
    novalidEmail.classList.add("hidden");
    window.location.href = `./src/subscribing-page.html?email=${encodeURIComponent(
      email
    )}`;
  } else {
    novalidEmail.classList.remove("hidden");
  }
};
```

### Continued development

In my future journey, I aim to enhance my skills by mastering CSS and JavaScript frameworks such as TailwindCSS and ReactJS. My goal is to create exceptional, responsive, and highly functional web applications.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - To get going for TailwindCSS, I used their documentation.
